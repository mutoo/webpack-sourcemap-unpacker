Webpack Sourcemap Unpacker
==========================

This is a very handy script to unpack the sourcemap generated by the webpack into a project structured folder.

Install
-------

I am not going to pubilsh this tools via npm. You could just clone this repo and run `yarn install`` to load the dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

And link it to your yarn bin folder, this will make it avaiable as a global command:
```
$ yarn link
```

Usage
-----

```
$ WebpackSourcemapUnpacker -h
Usage: webpack-sourcemap-unpacker [options]

Unpack the sourcemaps generated by Webpack to a project

  -p, --prefix [webpack:///]  filter the path with certain prefix
  -i, --input [glob-pattern]  a glob patterns to describe sourcemap files to be unpacked, default to *.map
  -o, --output [folder]       set the output folder, default to current folder
